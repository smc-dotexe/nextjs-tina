      ## Empowering Sustainability


      Karbon-X is focused on creating real-world solutions for carbon reduction.
      Through verified carbon offset projects, we help individuals and
      businesses take action against climate change by investing in
      environmental sustainability.


      ## How Karbon-X Started


      Oddly enough, Karbon-X didn’t start with our offset expertise or our
      investment in revolutionary technology like Heimdal. It started when the
      owner of a small trucking company wanted to do something positive for the
      environment and offset the emissions from his trucks.


      ## From Frustration to Innovation / Our Story


      Frustrated by the emissions from his companies daily commute, Chad Clovis
      sought carbon credits for his trucking company but quickly realized a
      major problem – access was difficult, and the companies involved weren’t
      adhering to science or international standards. Determined to change this,
      Chad sold his business and used the proceeds to fund Karbon-X, a company
      dedicated to making carbon credits accessible to all.


      ## How Karbon-X Makes a Difference 


      At Karbon-X, we make it easy for you to offset your carbon emissions
      through verified, impactful projects. Here’s how we do it:


      ## Sourcing the Best Projects


      We work with global partners to find and support sustainable projects that
      reduce carbon emissions. These projects include things like reforestation
      and renewable energy.
